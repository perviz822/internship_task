For the comprehensive analysis of  the  e-commerce websites google's lighthouse api is used. Briefly explaining, lighthouse api is an  open source api developed by google to  analyze the performance of the website, such as performance score, seo score, accessibility. You can find more info about the api from this link: [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/).

I used lighthouse api on every website in the list and stored their lighthouse data both for mobile and  desktop factors.

### The format of the lighthouse.csv

| url         | lighthouse_data           |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| example.com | { mobile:{}, desktop:{} } |
